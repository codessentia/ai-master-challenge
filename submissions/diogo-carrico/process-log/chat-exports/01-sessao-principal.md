This is **G4's hiring challenge for an "AI Master" role**. G4 is a Brazilian executive education company, and the repo is in Portuguese. You pick **one** of four business problems, solve it with any AI tools, and submit through a Pull Request. You can see there's already an `ai-master-challenge` folder in your working directory, probably a clone.

## How it works
- **Steps:** fork the repo → create a branch `submission/your-name` → put your work in `submissions/your-name/` → open a PR. Submitting by PR is part of the test.
- **Time budget:** 4–6 hours. There's no fixed deadline, but spots are limited.
- **Process log is mandatory.** Without evidence of how you used AI, you're disqualified. Accepted forms include chat exports, screenshots, a written narrative, git history or a commented notebook. They want to see how you broke down the problem, where the AI was wrong and how you fixed it, and what you added beyond it.
- **The catch:** G4 already ran every brief through Claude, GPT and Gemini, and those answers are the baseline. A submission that looks like pasting the brief into an AI won't pass. It has to clearly beat the baseline in depth, judgment or execution.

## The 4 challenges
| # | Challenge | Data (Kaggle) | Deliverable |
|---|---|---|---|
| 001 | **Churn diagnosis**: a B2B SaaS (RavenStack) where the CEO says "churn is up, but customer success (CS) says satisfaction is fine and product says usage grew" | 5 joined tables: accounts, subscriptions, feature usage, support tickets, churn events | Root-cause report, at-risk segments and accounts, prioritized actions. Extra credit: churn model or dashboard |
| 002 | **Support redesign**: ~30K tickets/year | Customer support tickets (30K) + IT ticket classification (48K, 8 categories) | Bottleneck diagnosis, an AI automation proposal including what *not* to automate, and a working prototype (e.g. a classifier) |
| 003 | **Lead scorer**: 35 sales reps, ~8.8K opportunities | CRM: accounts, products, sales teams, pipeline | **Working software** that ranks deals and explains *why* each one scores high or low. Needs setup, scoring logic and limitations docs |
| 004 | **Social media strategy** | 52K cross-platform posts with sponsorship flags | Engagement analysis, a sponsorship policy with fair controls, a prioritized strategy. Extra credit: predictive model or dashboard |

## What they grade
- Did you understand the problem before you started executing?
- Are the numbers verifiable?
- Do you separate correlation from causation?
- Are the recommendations actionable and prioritized?
- Can a non-technical executive act on the result?
- Do you know where *not* to use AI?

They push back on generic output, 40-page documents and a one-prompt process.

## Which to pick
- **003 (Lead Scorer)** fits Claude Code best. The deliverable is a running app, and a real git history doubles as your process log.
- **001 (Churn)** has the richest analytical "trap": the five tables are designed to contradict each other at first glance.

Do you want to pick one and get started? I can download the dataset, set up the submission folder structure and build the solution with you.

I've made a 14-slide deck: **[AI Master Challenge](https://claude.ai/artifact/7SS6VtPmtZxx2Umbw2Wkxw)**. It's in English and private, so other people can't open the link until you share it from the Share menu. You can also download it as PowerPoint or PDF from there.

**What's in it:**
1. **Cover**
2. **How it works:** fork the repo, solve one challenge with AI, keep a process log, open a PR. Plus the warning that G4 already has AI-generated answers to beat.
3. **What's graded:** what earns points and what gets rejected.
4. **Slides 4–11, two per challenge** (churn, support, lead scorer, social media):
   - **The problem:** the stakeholder's ask, the data available, and the trap built into each brief.
   - **A possible solution:** three steps (analyse, build, stand out) and one "watch out" point.
5. **Advice for all four:** check the data first. These are public Kaggle datasets and some may be generated, so show you checked whether the data holds any real signal before analysing it.
6. **Comparison table:** best-fit profile, main deliverable, hardest part and build effort for each challenge.
7. **Recommendation and next steps:** pick 003 (Lead Scorer) if you prefer building and 001 (Churn) if you prefer analysis, then a 6-step plan up to the PR.

**What to know:**
- **No real numbers yet.** Only the dataset sizes stated in the repo appear. I haven't downloaded the data, so findings like win rates or churn drivers are approaches to try, not results.
- **The two lead-scorer warnings are unchecked.** The deck says the CRM data ends years ago and may have product-name mismatches and missing dates. Both come from my memory of the dataset, so confirm them once you download it.
- **The quotes are my paraphrased English translations** of the Portuguese briefs.
- **The slide files are in your project folder,** in `presentation/`, because publishing from the temporary folder was blocked.

What would be the possibly the most perfect challenge for the position?

## Claude

**Challenge 002, the support redesign,** is the closest match to the role. It's the only one that tests every part of G4's own definition of an AI Master.

| What G4 says an AI Master does | 001 Churn | 002 Support | 003 Lead scorer | 004 Social |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Understands the business problem first | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Uses generative AI as a lever | Partial (tagging feedback text) | **✓ Core (classify, route, draft replies)** | Optional (scoring can be rules) | Partial |
| Delivers working solutions, not slides | Optional | **✓ Prototype expected** | ✓ Required | Optional |
| Knows what to automate and what not to | — | **✓ A required deliverable** | — | — |

**Why 002 stands out:**
- **It explicitly tests what the role is about.** The brief calls itself diagnosis plus process thinking plus building. The others mostly test one or two of those.
- **"What NOT to automate" is required here.** It's the last line of G4's AI Master description, and no other challenge asks for it directly. Its tips also call automating everything a red flag.
- **Generative AI is the solution itself.** You'd build a classifier with confidence scores, suggested replies and routing on 48K labelled tickets. The other three challenges can be solved well with plain analytics or rules.
- **The return on investment (ROI) story is natural.** You can say "this saves X agent-hours a month" in terms an operations director can act on.

**The risks:**
- **It has the most to deliver in 4–6 hours.** That's a diagnosis, a cost estimate, an automation design and a working prototype. Keep the prototype small and run it on real data: one classifier with an honest accuracy figure on held-out tickets beats a polished demo.
- **The main ticket dataset may be synthetic.** From memory, the Kaggle dataset has templated text and satisfaction scores that may not depend on anything; I haven't checked. If that's true, showing it with evidence and designing around it is exactly the kind of judgment G4 says the AI baseline lacks.

**When to pick another one:**
- **003 (Lead Scorer)** if you're mainly a builder. It's the safest to finish well, and Claude Code's commit history becomes your process log.
- **001 (Churn)** if you're strongest at analysis. It has the deepest analytical trap.

G4 also says to pick the challenge closest to a problem you've already solved at work. If one of these matches your experience, that edge can outweigh the fit above.

The deck's last slide currently recommends 003 or 001. Want me to update it to lead with 002, or to start setting up the 002 submission?

Challenge 002 is inconsistent about the prototype requirement.
Its introduction says the stakeholder wants something running and describes the challenge as testing prototype construction. The deliverables section labels the functional prototype a differentiator, and the quality criteria discuss it conditionally.
This makes the minimum passing scope ambiguous. The brief should explicitly declare the prototype mandatory or optional. For a competitive candidate submission, including a small working prototype is the stronger interpretation. Do you agree?

## Claude

Yes, I agree. The brief contradicts itself, and the stronger reading is to treat the prototype as mandatory in practice.

**The contradiction in the brief:**
- The introduction quotes the Director: "I don't want a PowerPoint. I want to see something running," and says the challenge tests three skills, including building.
- The deliverables section labels the prototype as a *diferencial* (differentiator), while the diagnosis and automation proposal are marked *obrigatório* (mandatory).
- The quality criteria say "if you built a prototype, does it work on real data?"

**Why to build one anyway:**
- G4 grades against AI baselines. A single prompt can produce a diagnosis and a proposal; it can't produce running, evaluated code. The prototype is the clearest way to separate your work from that baseline.
- The repository's README says a candidate who can "vibe code" a working solution has an advantage over one who only writes documents.
- Challenge 002 was my recommendation precisely because it tests all three skills. Dropping the build removes the strongest argument for choosing it.

**What that means for scope:** keep the prototype small and verifiable, roughly 1.5 hours of the plan. A classifier with honest per-class metrics on held-out tickets, wrapped in a minimal app or API, is enough. If time runs short, cut the interface before cutting the evaluation.

The terms of reference already treats it this way: deliverable D4 and objective O3 state it as required. I'd add one line in the Scope section noting the brief's ambiguity and the decision to build.

I paused the doc because the remaining section writes were declined. Sections 5 to 11 are still outstanding. Do you want me to continue filling them, with that note added?


## Diogo · 2026-10-13 19:08

What would be the deliverables?

## Claude

The submission has six deliverables, all inside `submissions/diogo-carrico/` in the pull request.

| # | Deliverable | Format | What makes it acceptable |
|---|---|---|---|
| **D1** | **Data audit** | Notebook plus a short section in the report | Every field profiled. A verdict on whether the data is synthetic, with evidence. Written limits on what the data can support. |
| **D2** | **Operational diagnosis** | Report section with tables and charts | Bottlenecks ranked by hours and volume, by channel × priority × ticket type. Satisfaction drivers quantified, or shown to be absent. Waste in hours per month and cost, with the hourly rate stated and adjustable. |
| **D3** | **Automation proposal** | Report section with the flow diagram | What to automate, what not to, and why. The flow from ticket arrival to resolution. The confidence threshold and human lane defined. Examples from the data. |
| **D4** | **Working prototype** | Python code, trained model, a small app or API, and setup instructions | Runs from the README on a clean machine. Trained on the real 48K tickets. Per-class precision, recall and F1 on thousands of held-out tickets. Takes raw text and returns category, confidence and route. |
| **D5** | **Submission README** | Markdown, following the repository template | Executive summary, approach, results, recommendations, limitations, setup. Readable by a non-technical director in 10 minutes. |
| **D6** | **Process log** | Markdown narrative, git history, chat exports or screenshots | Tools used and why. How the problem was broken down. Where AI was wrong and how it was corrected. What you added. Number of iterations. |

**How they map to the brief:** D2 is the brief's mandatory diagnosis, D3 its mandatory automation proposal, D4 the prototype we agreed to treat as required, and D6 the mandatory process log. D1 and D5 aren't named in the brief, but D1 is what protects you from building on a dataset that holds no signal, and D5 is required by the repository's submission template.

**Optional, if time allows:** a small dashboard of the bottlenecks, and an estimate of agent-hours saved per month at the chosen auto-routing rate. The second one is worth doing if possible, since the brief says a return-on-investment figure "changes the conversation."

This is the content I had drafted for section 6 of the terms of reference. Want me to write it, and the remaining sections, into the doc now?


## Diogo · 2026-10-13 19:11

Time is not a constraint at this point - I want the best possible deliverables. Also can you provide-me with a table of Monthly costs for tools to be developed and tools in the market place. For API's please quote OpenAI, Anthropic and any other from this list. Please consider also possible free API's.

## Claude

I'll research this properly rather than quote from memory: prices change, and several models on that chart are newer than my training data. I'm launching a multi-agent research pass (one researcher per provider cluster, each result adversarially re-checked against the official pricing page), and loading Anthropic's API reference in parallel.

- _ferramenta: Skill_
- _ferramenta: Workflow_
The research is running in the background: 8 researchers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, xAI/Mistral/Meta/NVIDIA, the Chinese and open-weight providers, free APIs, marketplace products, self-build infrastructure), each followed by an adversarial verifier that re-opens the cited pricing pages, then a coverage pass for any chart model still unpriced and a completeness critic. I'll build the tables once it reports back.

One cross-check already in hand from Anthropic's reference (cached 2026-10-06): Opus 5.5 $4 / $20, Sonnet 5.5 $2 / $10, Fable 5.1 $10 / $50, Haiku 5.5 $0.10 / $0.50 per million tokens in/out. The verifiers will confirm those against the live pricing page.


## Diogo · 2026-10-13 19:22

Meanwhile, we should proceed with the other parts of project that don't rely on this information

## Claude

Agreed. Two things don't depend on the cost research: finishing the terms of reference (sections 5–11, with the work plan reframed now that time isn't the constraint) and setting up the submission itself (fork, branch, folder skeleton, data). I'll start by checking the current state of both.

Your questions have been answered: "Python isn't installed on this machine, and the analysis and prototype need it. How should I set it up?"="Install uv via winget (Recommended)", "The two datasets come from Kaggle, which needs your account. How do you want to provide them?"="I'll add a Kaggle API token (Recommended)".

## Claude

- _ferramenta: Bash — Install uv for the current user with winget_
- _ferramenta: Bash — Install Python 3.12 via uv and create the solution project with analysis dependencies pinned_
Python 3.12 and the analysis libraries are installed. The warning about a version link is cosmetic; the interpreter runs. Checking whether your Kaggle token is in place yet:

- _ferramenta: Bash — Check for the Kaggle token and inspect the generated project layout_
Your Kaggle token isn't there yet, which is fine. I'll write the download script now so the data arrives with one command once the token exists. I'm also tidying the generated project config.

The PR analysis turned up a timing risk: G4 hasn't reviewed anything since 3 August. I'm checking whether the job posting is still open before writing up the findings.

I've finished reviewing all 184 public PRs. The two key Challenge 002 findings (the common template and the openings) were checked by independent fact-checkers, and I've used their corrected counts below.

**Bottom line:** Challenge 002 is crowded, and the idea that once set submissions apart is now the expected minimum. The job posting is still open, but G4 hasn't reviewed a PR in 10 weeks. Our current plan would probably land at "Forte" (about 7.5/10), not the top score, and it needs a few specific changes rather than more volume.

## The state of the repo
- **184 PRs:** 86 for Challenge 003, 40 for 001, 38 for 002 and 16 for 004.
- **Review status:** G4 reviewed 101 and approved 70 at some point. Its last review was **3 August**. 72 open PRs, including the 19 most recent Challenge 002 ones, have never been reviewed.
- **The posting is live** ("G4 Ai Master" at ats.g4business.com, "Candidatar-se" still active). Two things on it matter to you:
  - **Applying through the form comes first.** You apply there, then receive the challenge links by email. The PR alone doesn't count, and G4 sends approved candidates back to this form.
  - **Location is a hard requirement.** It's **on-site full-time in São Paulo**, listed as an elimination criterion. Pay is R$10k–40k a month. Please confirm both work for you before we invest more.

## How G4 judges
All reviews come from one reviewer, joaovitor2763, who uses an AI-assisted grader. The pattern:
- **"Uso de IA" (how you used AI) is 30% of the score**, and a missing process log is grounds for rejection. Reviews count things: screenshots, chat-export lines, commits, documented human decisions, AI errors you caught.
- **Rejections come from evidence problems:**
  - process logs that look AI-written
  - strategy produced by the AI before the candidate looked at the data
  - code that isn't in the repo
  - financial projections without sources
  - documents that contradict the code
- **Score bands:** "Excepcional" is 9 or above, "Forte" about 7.3–8.7. The top Challenge 002 score is #81 at 9.0. Lean and very large submissions have both reached the top, so size isn't what decides it.

## What nearly every Challenge 002 submission already does
- Audit Dataset 1 first (33 of 38) and call it synthetic. The evidence they cite:
  - 8,469 real records, not 30K
  - 49% of timestamps inverted
  - an unfilled `{product_purchased}` placeholder in the ticket text
  - uniform satisfaction scores
- Train TF-IDF with a linear model on Dataset 2. Results cluster at **84–87% accuracy**.
- Auto-route above a confidence threshold (30 of 38), and never automate refunds or cancellations (at least 25).
- Compare large language models (LLMs) against the classifier: the classifier won all 9 times. Have an AI review the work: 11 did.

## Where nobody, or almost nobody, has gone
| Opening | Done by |
|---|---|
| Reply drafts measured against a test set (25 claim drafting, only 1 evaluated anything generative) | 1 |
| Build-vs-buy with dated vendor prices and break-even volume | 1, only as a ceiling |
| Estimating how much of the ~13% error is label noise in Dataset 2 | 0 |
| Pilot sized statistically (how many tickets prove ≥95% precision) | 0 |
| Thresholds set from the cost of an error, after calibration | 2 |
| Testing on Portuguese text (one PR measured 85.7% → 41.5%) | 3 |

Our cost research makes the build-vs-buy row ours to win. The evaluated reply-drafting row also fits the posting, which lists agents and retrieval-augmented generation as elimination criteria.

## What this changes in our plan
1. **Cut scope.** Ship the 4 required deliverables plus about 3 differentiators, not 10 deliverables. The bottleneck dashboard, a separate pilot document and the video add risk without adding score.
2. **Don't build drafts or bottleneck rankings on Dataset 1.** Its "Resolution" text is filler, and its time fields are noise. Present bottlenecks and satisfaction drivers as tested null results instead, and estimate waste from labelled assumptions rather than those durations. One caveat: G4 did give 8.2 to two PRs that used those durations, so this is the more rigorous choice rather than avoiding a known penalty.
3. **Link the two datasets honestly.** Apply the Dataset 2 model to Dataset 1 text, measure how badly it fails (it calls 85–90% of tickets "Hardware"), and turn that into a guard.
4. **Make your judgment visible.** The reviewer-lens agent flagged that I drafted the terms of reference and the 10-deliverable plan, which matches the "strategy came from the AI" rejection pattern. The fix:
   - **You** commit a short hypotheses file in your own words before we open the data. Say honestly that you read the prior PRs first.
   - Keep a decisions log (AI proposed / you decided / why) and an AI-errors log.
   - Your calls so far already count: choosing 002, spotting the prototype ambiguity, insisting on reviewing the PRs before going further.
5. **Write the README in pt-BR, using R$.** 36 of 38 submissions are in Portuguese, and the reviewer writes in pt-BR.

## Where things stand
- **Second cost-research round:** still running.
- **Python:** installed through uv.
- **Download script:** written.
- **`stage.sh` staging helper:** written. It gets around the `.gitignore` trap and blocks secrets and files outside your folder.
- **Kaggle token:** still needed from you.

Before I update the terms of reference, I need you to decide:
1. Can you work on-site in São Paulo, and have you applied through the G4 form?
2. Do you agree to cut scope to the 4 required deliverables plus about 3 differentiators? I'd pick evaluated pt-BR drafting, build-vs-buy with break-even, and the label-noise ceiling with a calibrated threshold.
3. Will you write the hypotheses file yourself? I can give you a short template of questions to answer.


## Diogo · 2026-10-13 20:11

I can revoque this API before submission - do not worry

## Claude

Understood. Revoking the token before submission works. Your `KGAT_` pattern in `stage.sh` and the `access_token` entry in `.gitignore` also cover the repo side. The one remaining place it could leak is the process-log exports, so I'll scrub `KGAT_` strings from those too.

I'll check that the token works and download the data. I'll only list file names and sizes, without opening any rows, so your hypotheses file can still come first.

- _ferramenta: Bash — Check where the Kaggle token is stored without printing it_
- _ferramenta: Bash — Find where the token file was saved and check repo state_
I couldn't find the token anywhere Kaggle looks. There's no `~\.kaggle\` folder, no environment variable, and no token file in the project. If you shared it in an earlier session, that session has ended and I can't see it. Either way, saving it is a step you need to do yourself; I don't write credentials into files.

Kaggle tokens that start with `KGAT_` go in a plain-text file with no extension. Run these two commands to create the folder and open the file in Notepad:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.kaggle
```

```bash
notepad "~\.kaggle\access_token"
```

Paste the token as the only line, save, and tell me. I'll run the download and confirm it worked without printing the token.

Two other things:

- **The second cost-research round stopped partway** when the previous session ended. It covered free tiers, hosted prices for open-weight models, mid-market and add-on products, build-side infrastructure, and data protection. I can resume it and finished parts won't re-run, but it spends a few hundred thousand tokens on 8 research and fact-check agents. Should I resume it, or build the cost tables from the first round and close the gaps more lightly?
- **I still need your answers to the three questions from my last message** before I update the terms of reference:
  1. Can you work on-site in São Paulo, and have you applied through G4's form?
  2. Do you agree to cut scope to the 4 required deliverables plus about 3 differentiators?
  3. Will you write the hypotheses file yourself, before we open the data?

The second cost-research round stopped partway when the previous session ended. It covered free tiers, hosted prices for open-weight models, mid-market and add-on products, build-side infrastructure, and data protection. I can resume it and finished parts won’t re-run, but it spends a few hundred thousand tokens on 8 research and fact-check agents. Should I resume it, or build the cost tables from the first round and close the gaps more lightly? Resume it...

1. Can you work on-site in São Paulo, and have you applied through the G4 form? YES
2. Do you agree to cut scope to the 4 required deliverables plus about 3 differentiators? I’d pick evaluated pt-BR drafting, build-vs-buy with break-even, and the label-noise ceiling with a calibrated threshold. YES
3. Will you write the hypotheses file yourself? I can give you a short template of questions to answer.  YES - please give me the template of questions

The three process-log files are ready. Next I'm updating the terms of reference for the smaller scope, after checking whether you've edited the doc since my last change.

The terms of reference are updated, and your hypotheses template is ready: [process-log/00-hipoteses.md](ai-master-challenge/submissions/diogo-carrico/process-log/00-hipoteses.md).

**What's in the template:** 16 short questions in pt-BR. They cover:
- what you learned from the other PRs, and your own support experience
- Dataset 1, Dataset 2 and the label-noise question
- what never to automate, and the cost of a misrouted ticket
- what makes a pt-BR draft acceptable
- your build-vs-buy instinct
- what would change your mind
- what you'll do yourself versus delegate to AI

Section 6 is a table of **8 numeric predictions**. Fill in only the "Minha previsão" column now; we fill in the results after measuring. Committing predictions before measuring is something none of the other Challenge 002 PRs did, and it's hard evidence of your own thinking.

**How to fill it in so it counts:**
- Write it yourself, short, in your own words, without AI. The reviewer's AI-assisted check looks for this.
- Answer before the data is downloaded. Your Kaggle token isn't in place yet, so nothing has been opened.
- Commit it yourself. The commit date is the proof.

**Two more files are seeded with facts only:**
- [decisoes.md](ai-master-challenge/submissions/diogo-carrico/process-log/decisoes.md) lists 9 decisions so far. For each it records what the AI proposed and what you decided. Four of them started with you: the prototype ambiguity, reviewing the PRs, the cost tables and the token protection. **The "Por quê" column is yours to fill in.**
- [erros-da-ia.md](ai-master-challenge/submissions/diogo-carrico/process-log/erros-da-ia.md) lists 7 of my errors and how each was caught. Several were caught because you asked to review the PRs first. Edit anything you'd describe differently.

**[Terms of reference](https://claude.ai/code/artifact/aa2d192b-7227-4970-ae18-18430290a753) changes:**
- **Method:** six stages, starting with your hypotheses.
- **Deliverables:** D1–D4 plus X1–X3, with the dropped items listed.
- **Plan and quality mapping:** a new work plan and an updated map from G4's criteria to deliverables.
- **Assumptions and risks:** São Paulo and your application are confirmed. G4's inactivity and the crowded field are now listed as risks.
- **Process:** a new `stage.sh` submission path and a change log in section 13.
- **Budget:** section 12 waits for the last fact-checks, which are still running.

**One blocker for committing:** git has no author identity set, so commits would fail. Set it for this repo only. Your email appears publicly in the PR's commits, so you may prefer your GitHub "noreply" address (GitHub → Settings → Emails).

```bash
git -C "D:/2026_ai-master-challenge/ai-master-challenge" config --local user.name "Diogo Carriço"
```

```bash
git -C "D:/2026_ai-master-challenge/ai-master-challenge" config --local user.email "YOUR_EMAIL"
```

After that, shall I make the first commit (project setup plus the empty templates)? Your filled-in hypotheses then become a separate commit of your own, which makes the timeline clear.


## Diogo · 2026-10-13 20:20

Can we login using my codessentia user?

## Claude

Yes. The GitHub CLI on this machine is already signed in as **codessentia**, so I can take your commit identity from that account instead of typing it by hand. I'll use GitHub's private "noreply" email, so your personal address doesn't appear in the public PR.

- _ferramenta: Bash — Confirm the GitHub CLI login and read the account's name and id_
- _ferramenta: Bash — Set this repo's commit identity from the codessentia account and let git push through the GitHub CLI login_
You're signed in as **codessentia**. Every commit in this repo is now authored as:

- **Name:** Diogo Carrico (as on your GitHub profile)
- **Email:** `209881821+codessentia@users.noreply.github.com`. This is GitHub's private address and still links each commit to your profile.

I also connected git to that same login, so pushing to your fork `codessentia/ai-master-challenge` works without a password prompt. A test read of the fork succeeded. That connection is a global git setting on this machine, so it applies to your other GitHub repos too. The name and email apply only to this repo.

Shall I make the first commit now? It would contain the project setup and the three empty process-log templates. Your filled-in hypotheses then go in as a separate commit by you, before any data is downloaded.

The last three fact-checks are back, so all cost research is now verified. I'll merge both rounds and build the cost tables for section 12, which is your original request.

The "Cost tables" tab is created next to the main text. Next I'm filling Table A, which prices every model on your chart plus the smaller OpenAI and Anthropic models.

- _ferramenta: update_
Table A is filled in. Next is Table B, the free and near-free options. Only two of them can carry the full workload indefinitely.

Table B is filled in. Next is Table C: the self-built tool's monthly running cost in three setups, broken down component by component.

Tables C and D are in. Next is Table E, which shows which APIs can legally receive customer tickets, and then the sources.

- _ferramenta: update_
The tab is complete. Last, section 12 in the main tab gets the summary and a link to the tab. I'm checking the main tab for edits first.

- _ferramenta: Bash — Check whether the main tab changed since my last write_
- _ferramenta: Bash — Extract the text of the section 12 someone else wrote_
- _ferramenta: Bash — Outline the other section 12: headings, prose and table markers_
- _ferramenta: Bash — Check for files or session activity from another source_
I stopped before writing section 12, because I found a conflict.

**Another Claude session is working on this project at the same time.** The earlier session (`b62ecdc2…`) last wrote at 17:29, and I believe it's what did the following since my last edit:
- **Wrote the whole section 12** of the terms of reference. It's built from the same verified research and covers assumptions, the 27 chart models, free options, the self-built tool, marketplace tools and data protection, with sources under every table.
- **Probably added the `KGAT_` check to `stage.sh` and `access_token` to `.gitignore`.**

**Meanwhile I built a separate "Cost tables" tab** with the same content. The two now disagree on totals:

| | Section 12 (other session) | My tab |
|---|---|---|
| Self-built, lean production | $9–63 a month | $9–13 a month |
| Self-built, robust production | $161–264 a month | $143–223 a month |

These come from different component choices and maintenance assumptions, not from wrong prices. But one document shouldn't carry two sets of numbers. The other session's version is the more complete one: it adds per-table sources, a list of models retiring soon, and the providers whose data terms weren't assessed.

Two sessions editing the same doc and repo can also overwrite each other. That includes the commits and the process-log files, which need a clean timeline for G4.

Which session should carry on?
- **This one (my recommendation, since you're talking to it):** I delete my duplicate tab, keep section 12 as written, and continue from here. Then stop or close the other session.
- **The other one:** I delete my tab and stop working here.

Either way, the doc's version history keeps my tab if you want any of it back.


## Diogo · 2026-10-13 20:36

This one  - lets move with this one

## Claude

- _ferramenta: delete_
- _ferramenta: mcp__ccd_session_mgmt__list_sessions_
- _ferramenta: update_
- _ferramenta: mcp__ccd_session_mgmt__get_session_
You're set to continue here. Two cleanups:

- **I deleted my duplicate "Cost tables" tab.** The [terms of reference](https://claude.ai/code/artifact/aa2d192b-7227-4970-ae18-18430290a753) is back to a single tab, and section 12 is the only version of the costs. The doc's history keeps my tab if you ever want it.
- **The other session is no longer running,** so there was nothing to stop. The app lists no other sessions. It appears to have written section 12 and then exited.

Three things are waiting on you:

1. **Your hypotheses:** answer the questions in [00-hipoteses.md](ai-master-challenge/submissions/diogo-carrico/process-log/00-hipoteses.md), including the "Minha previsão" column. Also fill in the "Por quê" column in [decisoes.md](ai-master-challenge/submissions/diogo-carrico/process-log/decisoes.md).
2. **Your Kaggle token:** save it as `~\.kaggle\access_token` and tell me. I'll download the data but won't open it until your hypotheses are committed.
3. **The first commit:** shall I make it now? It would hold the project setup and the empty templates, authored as you (codessentia). Your answered hypotheses then go in as a separate commit.

I made the first commit, `0e19e00`. It's authored as Diogo Carrico with your codessentia noreply email and contains 13 files, all inside `submissions/diogo-carrico/`, with no secrets. It's local only; I haven't pushed anything to GitHub.

Before committing I fixed a bug in the `stage.sh` helper. On Windows it flagged every file as outside your folder. It now works, and I logged the bug as E08 in the AI-errors file.

**Your next step:** answer the hypotheses and fill in the "Por quê" column in the decisions log, then commit them yourself so the timestamp is yours:

```bash
cd "D:/2026_ai-master-challenge/ai-master-challenge" && ./submissions/diogo-carrico/stage.sh
```

```bash
git -C "D:/2026_ai-master-challenge/ai-master-challenge" commit -m "docs(diogo-carrico): hipóteses e decisões antes de abrir os dados"
```

Tell me when that's done and your Kaggle token is saved at `~\.kaggle\access_token`. I'll then download the data and start the audit.


## Diogo · 2026-10-13 20:43

Claro, sem pressa. Fico aguardando e não abro nenhum dado enquanto isso.

Quando terminar, faça o commit com os dois comandos acima e me avise. Se o token do Kaggle já estiver salvo em `~\.kaggle\access_token`, eu baixo os datasets e começo a auditoria.

## Claude

- _ferramenta: Bash — Check the end of the hypotheses file and which submission files changed_
Your hypotheses are complete: every question is answered, including all 8 predictions. Now I'm filling in the "Por quê" column of the decisions log with your reasons, word for word:

- _ferramenta: Write_
- _ferramenta: Bash — Check whether the Kaggle token is saved and which files are ready to commit_
Pronto. As suas razões estão na coluna "Por quê" do [decisoes.md](ai-master-challenge/submissions/diogo-carrico/process-log/decisoes.md), exatamente como você escreveu.

**Erros de digitação:** copiei suas palavras sem alterar, então ficaram três: "complexto" no D01, "complete" no D02 e "repositorio" no D09. Esse texto vai ficar público no PR. Quer que eu corrija esses três ou prefere manter como está?

**Suas hipóteses:** estão boas para o que o avaliador procura. Você mostra a sua experiência com o caso do reset de senha que passou do L1 ao L2. Também mostra ceticismo antes de ver os dados: escreveu que correlação perto de zero não prova que a base é sintética, e que não vai tratar todo erro do modelo como erro de rótulo. E admite que P1 e P2 foram influenciados pelos PRs que leu. Essa honestidade conta a favor.

Um detalhe: as respostas ficaram num bloco no fim do arquivo, e as linhas `>` embaixo de cada pergunta continuam vazias. Dá para ler assim mesmo. Se quiser, coloco cada resposta embaixo da sua pergunta sem mudar nenhuma palavra.

**Próximo passo:** os dois arquivos estão prontos para o commit. Rode você mesmo, para o horário do commit ser seu:

```bash
cd "D:/2026_ai-master-challenge/ai-master-challenge" && ./submissions/diogo-carrico/stage.sh
```

```bash
git -C "D:/2026_ai-master-challenge/ai-master-challenge" commit -m "docs(diogo-carrico): hipóteses e decisões antes de abrir os dados"
```

Ainda não encontrei o token do Kaggle em `~\.kaggle\access_token`. Assim que estiver lá e o commit feito, eu baixo os dados e começo a auditoria.


## Diogo · 2026-10-13 21:25

Blz. me da um segundo para pegar o novo token.

## Claude

Beleza, fico no aguardo.

Assim que o token estiver salvo em `~\.kaggle\access_token` e o commit das hipóteses feito, me avise. Eu baixo os dois datasets e confirmo sem mostrar o token. Até lá não abro nenhum dado.


## Diogo · 2026-10-13 21:26

o caminho para o token esta incorreto fv verificar

## Claude

- _ferramenta: Bash — Find where the installed Kaggle libraries look for credentials_
- _ferramenta: Grep_
- _ferramenta: Bash — Show where the Kaggle library looks for the token on this machine and search for token files_
Verifiquei no código da biblioteca do Kaggle instalada no projeto (`kagglesdk`, a parte que procura o token). O caminho está certo. Ela procura nesta ordem:

1. a variável de ambiente `KAGGLE_API_TOKEN`
2. `~\.kaggle\access_token`
3. `~\.kaggle\access_token.txt`, porque o Bloco de Notas costuma acrescentar `.txt`

O que falta é a pasta: `~\.kaggle` não existe. O Windows Explorer costuma recusar nomes que começam com ponto, então o mais fácil é criar pelo terminal:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.kaggle && notepad "~\.kaggle\access_token.txt"
```

Cole o token (a linha que começa com `KGAT_`) como única linha, salve e feche. O nome `access_token.txt` funciona.

Se preferir não salvar em arquivo, a alternativa é uma variável de ambiente só para o seu usuário. Feche e reabra o app depois, para eu enxergá-la:

```bash
setx KAGGLE_API_TOKEN "COLE_O_TOKEN_AQUI"
```

Me avise quando terminar, de preferência depois do commit das hipóteses. Eu confirmo que o token funciona sem exibi-lo e baixo os dois datasets.

The token is now in place in the right format. Before any download, here's the commit of your hypotheses and decisions:

- _ferramenta: Bash — Stage and commit the answered hypotheses and decisions before downloading any data_
Commit `d899d17` is in, timestamped 18:32:14, and the datasets folder is still empty, so the timeline is clean. Now the download:

- _ferramenta: Bash — Download both Challenge 002 datasets from Kaggle into the repo's datasets folder_
- _ferramenta: Bash — Confirm the downloaded data is ignored by git and the working tree is clean_
Tudo feito, nesta ordem:

1. **Token:** o arquivo tinha ficado como `access_token.txt.txt`, porque o Windows esconde a extensão e acrescentou um segundo `.txt`. Renomeei para `access_token`, sem mexer no conteúdo, e ele já está no formato certo.
2. **Commit das hipóteses:** `d899d17`, às 18:32:14, em seu nome. A mensagem diz que as hipóteses e as razões são suas e que a estrutura dos arquivos foi proposta pela IA. Ele foi feito com a pasta de dados ainda vazia.
3. **Download:** os dois datasets estão em `datasets/`, que o git ignora, então nenhum CSV entra no PR.
   - `customer_support_tickets.csv` (3,9 MB), o Dataset 1
   - `all_tickets_processed_improved_v3.csv` (14,6 MB), o Dataset 2

Os commits continuam só no seu computador; nada foi enviado ao GitHub.

O próximo passo é a auditoria dos dados (D1), começando por conferir suas previsões P1 e P2. Começo agora?

A auditoria está pronta. O relatório completo está em [docs/auditoria-dados.md](ai-master-challenge/submissions/diogo-carrico/docs/auditoria-dados.md), e todos os números saem do código, sem digitação manual.

**Veredito:** o Dataset 1 é sintético. Oito sinais, vindos de cinco partes diferentes da base, apontam na mesma direção. O Dataset 2 serve para treinar e avaliar o classificador.

**O brief está errado em quatro pontos, e é fácil verificar:**

| O brief diz | Os dados mostram |
|---|---|
| ~30.000 tickets | 8.469 registros. São 29.808 linhas porque 6.150 descrições têm quebra de linha |
| 3 tipos de ticket | 5 tipos. Reembolso e cancelamento somam 40,7% |
| "First Response Time" é um tempo | É um carimbo de data e hora. Sem a data de abertura do ticket, o tempo de resposta não pode ser calculado |
| CSAT para a operação | Só existe nos 2.769 tickets fechados (32,7%) |

**Os sinais mais fortes de dado sintético:**
- `{product_purchased}` aparece em 100% das descrições, e há mais 155 variações de placeholder.
- As resoluções não fazem sentido, por exemplo "Almost Republican let strategy.".
- Todos os e-mails são @example.com, .org ou .net.
- Todos os horários cabem numa janela de 27 horas.
- Em 49,3% dos tickets fechados, a resolução acontece antes da primeira resposta.
- Um modelo que tenta prever o tipo do ticket pela descrição acerta 18,9%, abaixo dos 20% do acaso.

**Suas previsões até aqui** (em [previsoes-resultados.md](ai-master-challenge/submissions/diogo-carrico/process-log/previsoes-resultados.md)):
- **P1 acertou em cheio:** 8.469 tickets.
- **P2 acertou:** a correlação entre tempo de resolução e CSAT ficou em ρ = 0,022, dentro da sua faixa de −0,10 a +0,10.
- **Hipótese 1.1:** três dos quatro sinais de dado sintético que você previu se confirmaram (descrição padronizada, combinações sem sentido, distribuições regulares). A "diferença clara entre canal e tipo" não apareceu: V de Cramér 0,02, sem relação. Registrei isso honestamente.
- **Sua ressalva se sustentou:** você escreveu que correlação perto de zero sozinha não prova nada. O veredito não depende dela.

**Dataset 2:** 47.837 tickets em 8 classes desbalanceadas, de Hardware (28,5%) a Administrative rights (3,7%). O texto já vem pré-processado: só minúsculas, sem números e sem pontuação. Não há nenhum texto duplicado, então o ruído de rótulo (X1) vai exigir revisão manual.

**Um erro meu, já corrigido:** a primeira versão testava a idade com um teste que não serve para números inteiros, e a idade apareceu como "não uniforme". Com o teste certo, ela é indistinguível de um sorteio. Está registrado como E09.

**Para o commit:** são 10 arquivos (código da auditoria, 4 testes que passam, resultados em JSON, o relatório e os logs atualizados). Os resultados somam 20 KB e nenhum CSV entra. Posso fazer o commit?

Commit `fc07d9b` está feito: 10 arquivos, nenhum fora da sua pasta e nenhum segredo. O histórico agora conta a ordem certa:

1. `0e19e00` — preparação do projeto
2. `d899d17` — suas hipóteses, antes de abrir os dados
3. `fc07d9b` — a auditoria que confere as hipóteses

Continua tudo local; nada foi enviado ao GitHub.

**Próxima fase: o diagnóstico (D1).** Vamos testar gargalos (canal × prioridade × tipo) e fatores de satisfação contra uma faixa de puro acaso, com correção para múltiplas comparações. Também vamos informar o menor efeito que esses testes conseguiriam detectar. O desperdício entra como estimativa paramétrica, com cada premissa rotulada, porque a base não tem como medi-lo. A sua resposta 1.3, sobre o que medir primeiro numa operação real, vira a recomendação de instrumentação.

Posso seguir para o diagnóstico?


## Diogo · 2026-10-13 21:49

go ahead

## Claude

Starting the diagnosis. The plan for each of the Director's three questions:

1. **Where does the flow stall?** For each cut (channel, priority, type, and their combinations), I shuffle the labels thousands of times. That shows how extreme the "worst segment" looks by pure chance, since with 80 combinations one of them always looks bad. For each cut I also report the smallest effect the test could have detected.
2. **What drives satisfaction?** Tests for every variable with false-discovery-rate correction, plus a model that predicts satisfaction compared against simply guessing the average.
3. **How much is wasted?** A parametric model with every assumption labelled and a sensitivity analysis. Coverage gets updated with the classifier's measured number in phase 5.

1. **Onde o fluxo trava?** Em nenhum ponto detectável.
   - Foram 36 testes: 4 indicadores em 9 cortes.
   - Só um segmento se destacou: "Low · Cancellation request", com 7,3 p.p. a mais de tickets sem solução (p = 0,02). Corrigido para os 36 testes, o p vira 0,86, ou seja, acaso.
   - A "pior combinação" de canal, prioridade e tipo também fica dentro do que um sorteio produz.
   - Os testes teriam detectado um canal com só 3,4 p.p. a mais de tickets sem solução.

2. **O que impacta a satisfação?** Nada mensurável.
   - Nenhuma das 8 variáveis se associa à nota: todas com q = 0,83.
   - Um modelo com todas elas erra mais do que chutar a média (1,22 contra 1,19 ponto de erro médio).
   - Uma diferença de 0,27 ponto entre canais teria sido detectada.

3. **Quanto desperdiçamos?** A base não permite medir.
   - A estimativa paramétrica dá **73 h/mês (R$ 3.281)** de triagem recuperável no cenário base, numa faixa de 2 a 172 h.
   - Cada premissa está rotulada com sua fonte. A cobertura de 50% é a sua previsão P5 e será trocada pelo valor medido no classificador.
   - O que mais pesa são os minutos de triagem por ticket, nunca medidos.
   - Isso confirma a sua hipótese 0.2: triagem é uma parte pequena do problema. O tempo some em transferências e espera, que a base não registra.

**Recomendação:** o relatório fecha com uma tabela do que medir numa operação real. Ela parte da sua hipótese 1.3 e mostra que a maioria desses campos não existe no Dataset 1.

**Para o commit:**
- 12 arquivos: o código do diagnóstico, o modelo de desperdício, os resultados, o relatório e 11 testes que passam.
- Entram também ajustes no relatório da auditoria: sinal de menos correto e um formatador compartilhado.
- Registrei mais um erro meu, o E10: tabelas quebradas por nomes de segmento com "|", já corrigido.

Posso fazer o commit? Depois dele vem a fase 5, o classificador. É lá que conferimos suas previsões P3, P5 e P6 e a hipótese de que Access é a categoria mais difícil.

A fase 5, o classificador (D3), está pronta: [docs/classificador.md](ai-master-challenge/submissions/diogo-carrico/docs/classificador.md).

**Resultado no teste**, usado uma única vez no fim:

| | Resultado | Sua previsão |
|---|---|---|
| Acurácia (TF-IDF + SVM linear) | **86,7%** (IC 85,8–87,6) | **P3: 86%, acertou** (a regressão logística ficou logo atrás, com 85,9%) |
| Classe mais difícil | **Administrative rights** (F1 78,9%). Os erros vão para Hardware, não para Access | **2.2: Access, não se confirmou** |
| Roteamento automático com ≥95% de precisão | **64,9%** dos tickets, com precisão de 97,0% | **P5: 50%, você subestimou** |

**O que vem das suas hipóteses:**
- **Um limiar por classe, como na sua 3.2.** Com um limiar único, Hardware ficaria em 92,9%; por classe, todas passam de 95%, exceto Storage. Storage ficou em 94,5% no teste, dentro da variação esperada, e o relatório explica isso.
- **Administrative rights nunca é roteado sozinho.** Os dados chegaram à mesma conclusão da sua 3.1.
- **Desperdício atualizado.** Com a cobertura medida, o cenário base passa para 100 h/mês (R$ 4.502). O relatório avisa que essa cobertura vale para tickets de TI, e que numa operação real só vale depois de treinar com os tickets dela.

**Dois achados importantes:**
- **Guarda de domínio:** aplicado ao Dataset 1, o modelo "acha" que 83,5% é Hardware, e 20,8% passaria dos limiares mesmo assim. O guarda de vocabulário barra 99,99% desses tickets e só 0,95% dos tickets legítimos.
- **Ruído de rótulo:** 105 grupos de textos quase iguais (617 tickets) têm rótulos diferentes. É o ponto de partida do X1.

**Um erro meu, pego antes do commit (E11):** o modelo de 12,5 MB ia entrar no commit, apesar do `.gitignore`. Corrigi as regras, e o `stage.sh` agora recusa qualquer arquivo acima de 2 MB. Testei com um arquivo de 3 MB e ele foi recusado.

**Reprodutibilidade:** rodei o pipeline inteiro de novo e os relatórios saíram idênticos. Os 19 testes passam e o lint está limpo.

**Para o commit:** 17 arquivos, sem o modelo e sem CSVs de dados brutos. Entra um CSV com os 617 tickets em conflito, cerca de 300 KB, como evidência para o X1. Posso fazer o commit?

**Depois do commit, três decisões são suas:**
1. **X1 (ruído de rótulo):** precisa de revisão humana. Eu preparo uma planilha com cerca de 150 casos, e você rotula. Topa?
2. **Comparar com embeddings e LLM, e medir a queda em português (P6):** precisa de uma chave de API. O custo deve ficar em poucos dólares, pela tabela de custos. Qual provedor você prefere?
3. **X2 (rascunhos em pt-BR):** precisa de uma base de conhecimento curta, escrita por você, ou que eu esboço e você revisa e assume. Qual prefere?


## Diogo · 2026-10-13 22:15

1. X1 (ruído de rótulo): precisa de revisão humana. Eu preparo uma planilha com cerca de 150 casos, e você rotula. Topa? Sim - 
2. Comparar com embeddings e LLM, e medir a queda em português (P6): precisa de uma chave de API. O custo deve ficar em poucos dólares, pela tabela de custos. Qual provedor você prefere? sem custos agora - apenas que alguma free api possa ser aplicada
3. X2 (rascunhos em pt-BR): precisa de uma base de conhecimento curta, escrita por você, ou que eu esboço e você revisa e assume. Qual prefere? esboce eu reviso e assumo.

## Claude

Combinado:
1. **X1:** preparo a planilha e você rotula.
2. **Sem custo:** o que dá para rodar localmente vai rodar sem nenhuma API.
3. **X2:** eu esboço a base de conhecimento, você revisa e assume.

Sobre o item 2, dá para cobrir boa parte **sem chave nenhuma**, rodando modelos abertos no seu computador:
- os **embeddings** multilíngues;
- a **tradução para português** que mede a sua previsão P6.

Só a **comparação com um LLM** e os **rascunhos do X2** precisam de um modelo de linguagem. Para esses, as opções gratuitas da pesquisa são o plano free da Groq ou o Google AI Studio. Os dois precisam que você crie uma chave gratuita, sem cartão. Pergunto isso no fim.

Primeiro, um ajuste no treino: ele passa a guardar a divisão e as previsões do teste. Assim a planilha do X1 e a comparação com embeddings usam exatamente os mesmos tickets. Também registro as palavras que mais pesam em cada classe, para servir de guia na revisão:

## Diogo (enviada durante o trabalho) · 2026-10-13 22:20

Quantos steps vc estima para a conclusao do case?

## Claude

- _ferramenta: SendUserFile_
1. **A planilha do X1** está acima: [revisao_rotulos.xlsx](ai-master-challenge/submissions/diogo-carrico/solution/outputs/x1/revisao_rotulos.xlsx).
   - São 150 tickets: 120 erros do modelo e 30 quase-duplicatas com rótulos diferentes.
   - Para cada ticket, você escolhe A, B, Outra ou Ambíguo.
   - A ordem das opções foi sorteada, então você não sabe qual é o rótulo original e qual é a previsão do modelo.
   - A aba "Instruções" lista as palavras que mais pesam em cada classe, como guia.
   - O texto vem pré-processado do dataset (só minúsculas, sem pontuação), então alguns tickets são difíceis de ler mesmo. "Ambíguo" é uma resposta válida.
2. **A chave do Google AI Studio:** em aistudio.google.com, clique em "Get API key". Depois crie o arquivo `submissions/diogo-carrico/solution/.env` com a linha `GEMINI_API_KEY=sua_chave` (o modelo está em `.env.example`).
   - Testei com uma chave falsa: o `.env` nunca é incluído no commit, e uma chave colada em qualquer outro arquivo é recusada pelo `stage.sh`.
3. **A base de conhecimento do X2:** são 11 artigos em [solution/kb/](ai-master-challenge/submissions/diogo-carrico/solution/kb/README.md), todos marcados como rascunho da IA.
   - Os prazos são políticas fictícias.
   - Os artigos do CDC citados são reais: 7 dias de arrependimento (art. 49) e 90 dias para produto durável com defeito (art. 26).
   - Confira principalmente o [11-escalonamento.md](ai-master-challenge/submissions/diogo-carrico/solution/kb/11-escalonamento.md), a lista do que a IA nunca responde sozinha. Quando terminar, me diga o que mudar e eu marco os artigos como revisados por você.

**Para registrar:** acrescentei ao log de decisões a D10 (revisão cega), a D11 (Google AI Studio, com a sua razão "sem custos agora") e a D12 (base de conhecimento esboçada pela IA e revisada por você).

**Pendente:** posso fazer o commit do classificador e dessa preparação? Seriam dois commits separados, para o histórico ficar claro. A planilha entra em branco agora e entra de novo preenchida quando você terminar, como evidência do trabalho humano.


## Diogo · 2026-10-13 22:21

to achando que complicamos demais.

## Claude

Concordo, e boa parte da culpa é minha. Depois que cortamos o escopo para 4 entregas + 3 diferenciais, eu deixei ele crescer de novo: planilha de 150 rótulos, base de conhecimento com 11 artigos, comparação com embeddings, LLM e português. Isso vai contra a própria evidência que levantamos. As submissões enxutas tiraram as melhores notas (#81 com 9,0; #104 "Excepcional"), o guia da G4 critica "40 páginas onde 5 resolveriam", e o desafio prevê 4 a 6 horas.

**O que já temos cobre o essencial:**
- **D1, diagnóstico:** feito e forte. O brief está errado em quatro pontos, os dados são sintéticos, nenhum gargalo é real (36 testes) e o desperdício estimado é de 100 h/mês.
- **D3, protótipo:** o classificador está pronto. Ele tem 86,7% de acurácia e roteia 64,9% dos tickets com 97% de precisão. O guarda barra os tickets fora do domínio, e Administrative rights nunca é roteado sozinho.
- **D4, process log:** suas hipóteses foram commitadas antes dos dados, e as previsões estão conferidas. Os logs de decisões e de erros da IA (11 erros) estão em dia.
- **Custos:** a seção 12 dos termos de referência já tem tudo verificado.

**Proposta para fechar em 3 etapas:**
1. **Proposta de automação e demo (D2 e D3).**
   - Uma página com o fluxo (IA roteia; humano revisa o resto e os casos sensíveis), a política do que nunca automatizar e os limiares.
   - Uma demo simples: você cola um ticket e ela devolve a classe, a confiança e "rotear" ou "humano".
2. **README em pt-BR, com 3 a 4 páginas.**
   - As três respostas ao Diretor, o protótipo e uma tabela curta de custos com o ponto de equilíbrio entre construir e comprar.
   - As limitações e o process log.
3. **Prints, revogar o token do Kaggle e abrir o PR.**

**O que eu cortaria:**
- **A revisão de 150 rótulos (X1).** Ficamos com a evidência que já existe: 105 grupos de textos quase iguais com rótulos diferentes.
- **Os rascunhos com LLM e a avaliação deles (X2).** A tabela de escalonamento vira a política de "nunca automatizar". Os outros 10 artigos saem.
- **A comparação com embeddings, LLM e português.** Assim **você não precisa mais da chave do Google**.
- **As previsões P4, P6 e P8.** Ficam registradas como "não testadas: cortadas do escopo", o que também é uma decisão sua e conta a favor.
- **As dependências que entraram para isso:** `google-genai`, `python-dotenv` e `openpyxl` saem do projeto.

Da sua parte, sobra ler o README, tirar alguns prints e aprovar o PR.

Fecho assim? Se quiser manter alguma das partes cortadas, me diga qual.


## Diogo · 2026-10-13 22:22

Coloque esses como sugestao para posterior analise e uma nota explicativa e fechamos com as 3 etapas sugeridas: 

A revisão de 150 rótulos (X1). Ficamos com a evidência que já existe: 105 grupos de textos quase iguais com rótulos diferentes.

* Os rascunhos com LLM e a avaliação deles (X2). A tabela de escalonamento vira a política de “nunca automatizar”. Os outros 10 artigos saem.
* A comparação com embeddings, LLM e português. Assim você não precisa mais da chave do Google.
* As previsões P4, P6 e P8. Ficam registradas como “não testadas: cortadas do escopo”, o que também é uma decisão sua e conta a favor.
* As dependências que entraram para isso: `google-genai`, `python-dotenv` e `openpyxl` saem do projeto.

## Claude

Combinado. Faço quatro coisas:
1. **Sugestões para análise posterior:** os itens cortados vão para um documento de próximos passos, com uma nota explicando o corte.
2. **Registro:** o corte entra como decisão sua (D13), com a sua frase como motivo.
3. **Erros da IA:** registro como E12 o fato de eu ter deixado o escopo crescer de novo. Quem pegou foi você.
4. **Limpeza:** removo as dependências e os rascunhos que não vão mais ser usados.

Depois sigo direto para a etapa 1.

Não sobrou nenhum "Carriço" com cedilha.

Três detalhes:
- **Autor dos commits:** eles saem como "Diogo Carrico", o nome do seu perfil no GitHub. Se quiser o nome completo nos próximos, eu ajusto a configuração deste repositório. Os commits já feitos ficam como estão.
- **LinkedIn:** o template tem um campo para o seu perfil, ainda vazio. Se quiser, me mande o link.
- **Commits pendentes:** posso fazer os dois commits de uma vez? Um é o do classificador (fase 5). O outro é o do corte de escopo: próximos passos, logs atualizados, dependências removidas e o seu nome. Depois sigo para a etapa 1, a proposta de automação com a demo.

2. **Corte de escopo:** próximos passos, logs atualizados (D13, D14, E12), dependências removidas, seu nome completo e o LinkedIn.

Posso fazer os dois e seguir para a etapa 1, a proposta de automação com a demo?


## Diogo · 2026-10-13 22:26

seria interessante colocar um fluxograma visual da automacao tb.

## Claude

Ótima ideia, e isso entra na etapa 1. Vou fazer o fluxograma de duas formas:
- **No repositório:** dentro da proposta de automação, em Mermaid, um formato que o GitHub desenha sozinho. Quem abrir o PR vê o diagrama, e os números vêm direto dos resultados do modelo.
- **No sumário executivo:** como figura, para a reunião do conselho técnico.

Já começo a etapa 1: a política de "nunca automatizar", a demo de triagem e a proposta com o fluxograma. Começo pela política, com as regras que mandam o ticket para um humano antes de qualquer modelo:
